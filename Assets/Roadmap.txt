If at the end of your turn you have no food, you get "You have no more food\nX of your warriors have just died of starvation(which blinks)\nPress return to continue"  If you have less than X, you get the message 'Do you want to pray for help(y/n)?'
If you don't have enough warriors (and maybe other units), you get the message that "you have to drop some gold"

Encounters
	- Parlay mechanic - start testing the input gathering and test the code to add the force numbers to the party - only warriors, elves, and dwarves
	- Playing a second sound on surprise never plays - probably related to sounds don't always finish playing
	- It's interesting, aren't elves parley-able?  No they are because I left out Dragon & WitchKing in the enum.  I have put them in.  If not, I have to change isParlayable() in UnitsData.cs  2230  PRINT : IF S = 0 OR S > 14 THEN  PRINT "DO YOU WISH TO PARLEY";:
	- After initial encounter, if you get the chance to run away, the screen should NOT clear before asking "Will you run away"

I is a 2d array of P = player (I think) and the second index (1-22) are the types:

0: RATION
1: TELEPORT SPELL
2: CLERIC
3: SCOUT
4: GOLD PIECE
5: WARRIOR
6: SWORD (DRAGON SLAYER)
7: RAIDER
8: SPELL OF SEEING
9: RAFT
10: MULE
11: WIZARD  (0X8A36)
12: MAGIC MAP 1 / HORN OF OPENING   (8A38 = 0x0A or 0x0B)
13: MAGIC MAP 2 / BOOTS OF STEALTH  (8A3A = 0x0A or 0x0B)
14: MAGIC MAP 3 / ARMOUR OF DEFENSE (8A3C = 0x0A or 0x0B)
15: MAGIC MAP 4 / SWORD OF STRENGTH (8A3E = 0x0A or 0x0B)
16: RAIDED FLAG   8A40
17: HAMMER OF THOR   8A42
18: TALISMAN OF SPEED 8A44
19: SPELL OF SEEKING   8A46
20: HORSES				8A48
21: ELVE				8A4A
22: DWARVE


In Apple IIe, I% is stored at 8A00

Master TODO:
- Finish Inventory Screen
- Error: Start from MainMenuScene and choose "S" to stay.  Error because GameStateManager.getGameState().setCurrentTileName() has not been called yet.  This may or may not occur during normal gameplay
- Rations need to decrease
- Implement random you find stuff scene
- Spells
- Magic Map
- Load/Save - serialization of state - json?
- Multiplayer
- Map level difficulty mechanic
- Player level difficulty mechanic
- Remove GamesState.initForDemo(), BattleSceneEvents.initForDemo() and remove GameState-deleteme from MainMenu scene

- Rando todos:
"STAND BY.  FILLING ARRAYS" should be in negative text
Sounds don't always finish playing
- double check the formula for parlay success with Wade Clarke's FAQ/game - only need 100 food/gold?
- Get better about the naming convention of input fields like VisitScreenInput vs inputNumPlayers
