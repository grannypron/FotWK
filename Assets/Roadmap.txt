If at the end of your turn you have no food, you get "You have no more food\nX of your warriors have just died of starvation(which blinks)\nPress return to continue"  If you have less than X, you get the message 'Do you want to pray for help(y/n)?'
If you don't have enough warriors (and maybe other units), you get the message that "you have to drop some gold"

Encounters
	- Parlay mechanic - start testing the input gathering and test the code to add the force numbers to the party - only warriors, elves, and dwarves
	- Run away mechanic - // TODO: GO BACK TO MAIN MENU on line 84 of BattleSceneEvents
	- Playing a second sound on surprise never plays - probably related to sounds don't always finish playing
	- 3520  PRINT "YOU HAVE FOUND THE FOLLOWING ITEMS" mechanic
	- It's interesting, aren't elves parley-able?  If not, I have to change isParlayable() in UnitsData.cs  2230  PRINT : IF S = 0 OR S > 14 THEN  PRINT "DO YOU WISH TO PARLEY";:

I is a 2d array of P = player (I think) and the second index (1-22) are the types:

0: RATION
1: TELEPORT SPELL
2: CLERIC
3: SCOUT
4: GOLD PIECE
5: WARRIOR
6: SWORD (DRAGON SLAYER)
7: RAIDER
8: SPELL OF SEEING
9: RAFT
10: MULE
11 is magic map?
12: WIZARD
13: HORN OF OPENING
14: BOOTS OF STEALTH
15: ARMOUR OF DEFENSE
16: SWORD OF STRENGTH
17: HAMMER OF THOR
18: TALISMAN OF SPEED
19: SPELL OF SEEKING
20: HORSES
21: ELVE
22: DWARVE

Maybe use generics more for the monsters?

Remove GamesState.initForDemo(), BattleSceneEvents.initForDemo() and remove GameState-deleteme from MainMenu scene

- Rando todos:
"STAND BY.  FILLING ARRAYS" should be in negative text
Sounds don't always finish playing
- double check the formula for parlay success with Wade Clarke's FAQ/game - only need 100 food/gold?
- Get better about the naming convention of input fields like VisitScreenInput vs inputNumPlayers
