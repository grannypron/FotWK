Encounters
	- Parlay mechanic - start testing the input gathering and test the code to add the force numbers to the party - only warriors, elves, and dwarves
	- Run away mechanic
	- Playing a second sound on surprise never plays - probably related to sounds don't always finish playing
	- 3520  PRINT "YOU HAVE FOUND THE FOLLOWING ITEMS" mechanic
Capture Player name on start screen
Inventory screen
570  PRINT "  "I%(P,X);: HTAB 10: PRINT ": "I$(X);: IF I%(P,X) > 1 THEN  PRINT "S";
I is a 2d array of P = player (I think) and the second index (1-22) are the types:

0: RATION
1: TELEPORT SPELL
2: CLERIC
3: SCOUT
4: GOLD PIECE
5: WARRIOR
6: SWORD (DRAGON SLAYER)
7: RAIDER
8: SPELL OF SEEING
9: RAFT
10: MULE
11 is magic map?
12: WIZARD
13: HORN OF OPENING
14: BOOTS OF STEALTH
15: ARMOUR OF DEFENSE
16: SWORD OF STRENGTH
17: HAMMER OF THOR
18: TALISMAN OF SPEED
19: SPELL OF SEEKING
20: HORSES
21: ELVE
22: DWARVE


In Apple IIe, I% is stored at 8A00

8374 starts this text, which should be lined up with the I values:

Preumably, this is the order, although it is backwards in memory:

Presumably then, here are our indexes for non-player types, which tracks with line 2230 (parley mechanics):
0: WARRIOR
1: BANDIT
2: WEREBEAR

4: ORC

Battles - Battle Scene
	- Player name on battle screen

	 FIGURE OUT WHERE O(S) COMES FROM!!!  L = O(S):                                              S is the monster type

	 I changed the disk image to print out L on the encounter screen instead of X and here is what I found: - just keep doing that to print out the values - "D:\FotWK\Apple2Source\Fortress-of-the-Witch-King_Apple-II_EN\Fortress of the Witch King (1983)(Avalon Hill) - Copy.do"
1 warrior
.6 hobgoblins  (99 99 99 99 02???)
.7 bandits
.3 goblins
10 trolls
16 ogre
20 earth giants
40 hydra
30 gorgon
50 hacker
3 dwarves (C0 00 00 00 00)
2 elves  (80 00 00 00 00)
But these are floating point, so I have to find out how they are stored in memory


	- Each round doesn't necessarily contain combat - check out the first encounter after inventory.C64, we see two wizards and we are surprised, but no combat happens, just a round update

Implement random you find stuff scene
Maybe use generics more for the monsters?
Spells
Magic Map
Load/Save - serialization of state - json?
Moves per turn
Map level difficulty mechanic
Player level difficulty mechanic
Remove GamesState.initForDemo(), BattleSceneEvents.initForDemo() and remove GameState-deleteme from MainMenu scene

- Rando todos:
"STAND BY.  FILLING ARRAYS" should be in negative text
Sounds don't always finish playing
- double check the formula for parlay success with Wade Clarke's FAQ/game - only need 100 food/gold?
- Get better about the naming convention of input fields like VisitScreenInput vs inputNumPlayers
